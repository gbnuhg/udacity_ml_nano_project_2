## Overview of the Project
The project started with an AutoML run. We uploaded the bank marketing dataset, created the experiment and computer cluster, and ran a classification experiment.

Through this, we identified the best model as the VotingEnsemble.

## Improvement
- Try different/more metrics besides AUC_weighted to see if another option performs better with the dataset or subsequent datasets. 
- As populations age, their tendencies change. As we move forward, it would be nice to get additional data or compare the data that we have to another segment of time. We could draw inferences between the timelines or see how the population changes over time.
- Alter the exit criteria for a longer duration to attempt more models when choosing the best model.
